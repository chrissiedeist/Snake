#Snake

This is a browser version of the classic snake game in which the player
directs a snake around the board in search of the apples. Eating an
apple causes the snake to grow (and earn points). 

## How to play:
* Turn the snake using `w` `a` `s` `d` keys
* Pause game execution with space bar

## Todos

* Board should really only contain one apple at a time...
* Snake should die when it hits a wall
* Obstacles should appear
